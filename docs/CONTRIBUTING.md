# Welcome to our contributing guide

Thank you for spending your time and contributing to the Optimism Collective :red_circle::sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community collaborative and respectable.

## Getting started

### Discussions section

The [Discussions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions) section is for announcements, developer questions, and general discussion.

#### Discussion

This section is for general discussion, share ideas, and show off the things you've built!

#### Developer questions

Ask and answer developer questions relating to the core protocol, deploying an OP Stack chain, developing on an OP Stack Chain, node operations, and other miscellaneous questions.

### Open a pull request

#### [Community section](../community) 

Open a pull request to append an OP Stack developer resource or tool to the list. Please include the link as a header tag and a short description underneath. It should look something like this:

```md
## [Resource Title](Resource Link)

A description of the resource. The resources are meant to serve developers. Please keep the description to the point.
```

#### [Community tutorials](../community/tutorials)

Feel free to carve out your own directory in the community tutorials section. Please follow these guidelines to contribute:

- Create a directory with your product or service's name in `kebab-case`
- Add a `README.md` to give an overview of your product or service. The top of the file should include the following, but the rest is your free reign
  ```
  # <Product or service name>
  maintainer(s): @github-username
  ```
- The maintainer is the user(s) that is responsible for maintaining the content. If there is more than one maintainer, please create a comma seperated list.
- Create tutorial files in your directory.

Its recommended to have your first tutorial be a quickstart, with step-by-step "learn by doing" instructions.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue:

- [monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) issues with the core protocol or SDK
- [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) issues with `op-geth` 
- [documentation](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub) issues with the documentation
- [OP Stack docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/stack-docs)

If you feel that the issue doesn't belong in one of these repositories, please open one [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/issues) and we'll figure out how to address it.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues in any of the repositories listed above to find one that interests you. You can narroew down the search using `labels`. If you find an issue to work on, you can signal your interest, and consult the local `CONTRIBUTING` document to open a PR with a fix.
