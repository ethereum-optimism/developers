## How to use this repository

### Developer question and answers ❓

If you have developer questions head over to our [Discussions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions) section. Tips on how to ask good questions:

- **First search for a duplicate question.** If you find one, follow up in that thread.
- **Do some initial research.** Suggested resources are available in each sections discussion form.
- **Be specific and clear.** Provide as much detail as possible. Include error messages, logs, code snippets, and a description of what you've tried so far.
- **Explain your goal or intention.** This can help us provide a more relevant and helpful answer.
- **Consider including a minimal reproducible example.** Being able to reproduce your issue makes it much easier for us to understand and diagnose the problem.
- **Be patient and respectful.** We are a community of people (and maybe some benevolant AIs), so please be kind. Always abide by our [Code of Conduct](./docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

When you get your answer, please mark it. We're always open to constructive feedback, so let us know how we're doing!
