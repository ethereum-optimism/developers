# Developer Community Resources

This directory contains developer resources that the OP Stack developer community use and create. 

Contributions to this directory can be made by anyone. They just need to follow these guidelines:

## Guidelines

**Disclaimer: The contents of this directory does not imply endorsement. All content should be evaluated independently.**

### Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to **serve developers on the OP Stack**. It's _not_ meant to be advertising space. While this may drive traffic to your resource; it's meant to assist development on the OP Stack.

### Eligibility

Contributions to this directory are intended to support the developers building on any layer of the OP Stack. Unrelated PRs will be closed with the following message:

> Thank you for your submission to our community resources. After consideration, we regret to inform you that we are unable to include your content at this time.
> It appears that the submitted content is not directly related to development on the OP Stack. As such, we must prioritize resources that are more aligned with our community's needs and interestes.
> Thank you for understanding.

### Maintenance

OP Labs cannot commit to maintaing third-party resources. We'll leave it up to the authors and community to maintain these resources.
