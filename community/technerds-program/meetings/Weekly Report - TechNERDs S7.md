<summary><b>Week 3 - 2025/2/24 to 2025/3/2</b></summary>

- **Main Focus**
  - Brief summary of the week’s main objectives, priorities, and key achievements.
    1. This week is `ETHDenver 2025 week`. `Chom,` `Tipi`, and `simple8720` participated in answering questions in the `Superchain dev` `eth-denver` channel. However, based on the criteria outlined in [Mission](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/268) under the `Hackathon Support` section, no one met the requirements.
    2. We tested the `Superchain dev tickets system`, but the migration of dev support to `Superchain dev` has been progressing slowly.
    3. We accelerated the process of closing `discussions` in the `developer repository` and proposed [Proposal: A One-Time Cleanup of Unclosed Discussions in the Developers Repository](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDxb1fYmpKmTUetDXgwMENHs3bDIOtNBj_gCU6dh1_A/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.phlb6zrmbb91).
    4. `jsvisa` investigated issues related to the deployment of L1 contracts using the forge script `scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy` in both the `develop` and `other release` versions. We plan to improve the documentation for this section.
    5. The [TechNerds channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1141037410717814844) is hosting some valuable discussions.
- **Team Feedback**
  - Feedback received from team members.
    > Currently, TechNerds does not have permission to manage the `TicketEase system(Superchain devs server)`. Additionally, `jsvisa (.j8j)` needs to be granted the T`echNerd role` in the server. —simple8720
    > Tipi is unable to chat in the `app-dev` channel on the Superchain dev server. -- Tipi
    > The faucet has run out of Sepolia ETH. -- Tipi [More details](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1141037410717814844/1345777810358403143)

<summary><b>Week 4 - 2025/3/3 to 2025/3/9</b></summary>

- **Main Focus**
  - Brief summary of the week’s main objectives, priorities, and key achievements.
    1. This week, we discussed the migration of support to the `Superchain-devs` server (`Discord` part) and received [feedback](https://www.notion.so/Weekly-Report-TechNERDs-S7-19da10f7e9568065894bd1b41c19b5c7?pvs=21) from `hash1go` and `tipi`.
    2. This week, `simple8720` drafted the **Criteria for Evaluating Active TechNERDs** and a draft template for contribution tracking.
    3. This week, we suggested adding a bridge that applies `viem` to our `OP Stack testnet` in the docs, based on efforts from `chom` and `simple8720`.
    4. `simple8720` attempted to upgrade our `OP Stack` testnet (without fault-proof) to support `Pectra`.
    5. `joohhnnn` leveraged their understanding of the `Fault Proof VM` to address related issues, `jsvisa` showed great enthusiasm in reproducing complex user-reported issues, `tipi` tracked common `faucet` issues, and `chom` utilized their extensive experience with `L1` and `L2` infrastructure operations to assist users.
- **Team Feedback**

  - Feedback received from team members.

    > "...the priority of improving the Superchain Dev Discord server should be higher...", "...limited opportunities to contribute and fail to reach 18 active weeks..." — `hashigo` [more details](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1346468681512915075/1346480927739613245)

    > The `Superchain Faucet` on the [Superchain Dev Console](https://console.optimism.io/) seems to have a common issue — `tipi` [more details](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1141037410717814844/1345777810358403143)

    > "Reaching 18 active weeks" presents a challenge, and details on how to track contributions need to be determined as soon as possible — `simple8720`

    > Feedback and evaluation are requested regarding [A One-Time Cleanup of Unclosed Discussions in the Developers Repository](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1141037410717814844/1346158638925873172), which involves resolving 80% of discussions within 48 hours — a highly challenging metric. — `simple8720`

    > Due to the Pectra upgrade on L1, the existing documentation may no longer be applicable for setting up an `own OP Stack` testnet on `Sepolia`. A temporary solution may be needed, which could be provided by `TechNERDs` rather than the `docs` team. —`simple8720`

    2.  Currently, no new valid **tickets** have been created on this server.
    3.  **Joohhnnn** investigated the `withdrawal process without relying on third-party dependencies`, which could resolve a long-standing issue, as some users prefer to minimize dependency usage. [more details](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions/692#discussioncomment-12667621)
    4.  Several `important topics` were confirmed in `last week's meeting`, and the `action items` were handled in a very `friendly manner`. This week, the retrospective `contribution submissions` need to be pushed forward.

    2. **Criteria for Evaluating Active TechNERDs:**

       Currently, resolving a single issue in the `general Discord channel` earns a maximum `T-shirt` score of **S**. For more **complex problems**, please guide users to **open a ticket** or **start a GitHub discussion**.`--simple8720`

- **Main Focus**
    - Brief summary of the week’s main objectives, priorities, and key achievements.
        1.  **Github Discussion:** Created  7, Closed  6**; Discord Ticket:** Created 0
        2. **Updated** : [**Superchain Devs Weekly Digest**](https://www.notion.so/Weekly-Report-TechNERDs-S7-19da10f7e9568065894bd1b41c19b5c7?pvs=21)
        3. **All active techNerds** members have updated their **personal contributions** up to **May 4, 2025**. These PRs have not yet been merged.
        4. We compiled the [April discussion list](https://www.notion.so/Discussion_April-List-1eda10f7e9568086b3ffea4d8a3ab6cd?pvs=21) / [other Metrics](https://www.notion.so/Data-Collection-Request-1bca10f7e95680f7acfedee7f701919a?pvs=21). Overall, **discussions** have become **less active**, and there are still few developers participating in open discussions in May.
        5. We may have seriously **overlooked the key concerns of developers** — *interop* has become a major focus of discussion, yet we have contributed almost nothing to related topics.
        6. **We closed 80% of discussions within 48 hours in pass two weeks** .
- **Team Feedback**
    - Feedback received from team members.
        1. **Feedback on the Contribution Report Template:**
        - I'm not sure about the recommended naming convention for the Markdown file. Is there a defined standard for this?
        - For the "Question Topic" field, I would prefer to have a set of standard categories to choose from, rather than entering free-form text.
        - There is currently a column for the total number of discussions per week. However, since the activity status is determined by the total number of T-shirt points, a dedicated column for the T-shirt point total should be included as well.
        - (This is not directly about the contribution template) Given the recent decline in technical questions, I suggest keeping the active week threshold at 3 points for Season 7, consistent with previous seasons. If any change is to be made for Season 8 and beyond, it should follow a proper discussion and consensus process.
        — *hashigo*
        
        1. Regarding the above feedback, I suggest we document it for now and revisit it for discussion at a later time.
