# Application Infrastructure

Building on blockchain from scratch is often tedious, difficult to integrate, and requires specialized knowledge. For traditional developers this can be a daunting task, and is a key obstacle to web3 adoption. Application infrastructure tools help abstract many complexities found in blockchain, such as paying for gas fees, transaction signing and confirmation, private key management, and smart contract deployment.
